# Archetype API  <!-- corrected "Arcetype" to "Archetype" -->

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Work_in_Progress-orange)

## Introduction
This project aims to create a standard for narrative storytelling. Effectively using this API will allow writers to make use of archetypes for storytelling. This could range from brainstorming unique cast members to designing a complex open-world game.

## Motivation
I decided to work on this project because of my love for classic storytelling and my disdain for amazing movies and TV shows with boring characters or plotlines.  <!-- corrected "storytellig" to "storytelling" and "distain" to "disdain", and "tvs" to "TV" -->
